# Branches

There are two main branches involved in developments & releases:
* master
* dev

All PRs will be merged to the dev branch, but must be written against the master branch to make merging easier.

Changes to the dev branch are merged once a new firmware release is imminent.

Things have been organised this way for the sake of stability and sanity.
